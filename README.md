- linked list
    - [X] Singly linked list
    - [X] Doubly linked list
    - [X] Circular linked list
    - [X] Intrusive doubly linked list
- tree
    - [X] Binary search tree
    - [X] Red-black tree
    - [X] Intrusive rbtree
    - [X] AVL tree
    - [X] Intrusive AVL tree
    - [X] Threaded AVL tree
- heap
    - [X] Binary heap
- hash table
    - [X] Chained approach
    - [ ] open addressing approach
