A practice to some of the most basic data structures, including:
- linked list
    - [X] singly linked list
    - [X] doubly linked list
    - [X] circular linked list
    - [ ] intrusive doubly linked list
- tree
    - [X] binary search tree
    - [X] red-black tree
    - [ ] intrusive rbtree
    - [ ] AVL tree
- heap
    - [X] binary heap
- hash table
    - [ ] chained approach
    - [ ] open addressing approach
